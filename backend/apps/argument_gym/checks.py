"""The catalog of checks a session can run, and the author's choice among them.

Every check the gym can make is declared here with what it needs to run. The
author picks; nothing is added to a run because it seemed useful. A check that
was turned off and a check that could not apply are different things and are
reported differently, because "no findings" from a check that never ran is the
one result that must never look like a clean bill.

`requires` names a precondition the session either has or does not:

* ``native_draft`` -- the brief is a HaddenDraft document, so the drafting
  validation rules have a template and a session to read.
* ``court_profile`` -- a court's filing rules are selected or detected.
* ``case_record`` -- there are case materials to check the brief against.
* ``checklist`` -- the author attached one of their own checklists.
