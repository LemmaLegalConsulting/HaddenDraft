# Stage 2: Python dependencies, built and slimmed in a stage that is thrown away
FROM python:3.12-slim AS pydeps

# Dependencies are installed into a virtualenv in a throwaway stage, slimmed
# there, and only the result is copied into the runtime image. Doing the removal
# in a later layer of a single-stage build saves nothing: layers are additive, a
# delete writes a whiteout, and the bytes stay in the image. That mistake cost
# this file a round trip -- the slimming script reported 24MB removed and the
# image did not change size at all.
#
# What is NOT removed, deliberately: babel's locale-data (docxcompose formats
# document properties through it), nltk (textstat imports it) and setuptools
# (textstat declares it at runtime). They are the largest things left and all
# three are load-bearing. Alpine was measured too and is a wash -- its smaller
# base is cancelled out by larger musl wheels.
